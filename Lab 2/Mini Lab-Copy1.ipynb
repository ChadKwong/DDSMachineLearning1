    "When it comes to log-loss scores, the model with the lower score is superior. Log loss is an indication of how close the prediction probability is to the actual value. As the probability diverges from the actual value, the log loss score increases. With this logic, we can see that the logistic regression model performs better by less than 5% (3.68159 < 3.84586) when it comes to full models. We also consistently obtained slightly higher accuracy scores through logistic regression (89.3% vs 88.4%). In terms of performance, we also saw advantages to the logistic regression model. Our logistic regression model took less than a second to run while we saw performance times as low as 8 seconds with the SVM model. With this in mind, we suggest the application of a logistic regression model over a SVM model for this specific classification problem.\n",

If we were to compare the two models using the non-encoded data set, we would have expected the SVM model to display a better Log Loss score because SVM models are ideal for multiclass approaches to classification. The dataset utilized in these models is already structured with identified independent variables and SVM is known to perform better on data sets that are less structured, so there is further evidence to suggest that our dataset is better utilized through a logistic regression model. \n",

Of these three variables, emp.var.rate and cons.price.idx are variables that do not vary between different people. Instead they are statistics that are updated every quarter. the euribor3m variable also shares this characteristic, although it is an international statistic that measures the interest rates of European banks. While these variables may present some inbalance to the model, they also present evidence that the likelyhood of a client subscribing to a term deposit may depend heavily on the socio-economic status of the country as well as the length the campaign to get the client to subscribe. \n",

This is further evidence to suggest that a time series model may be appropriate for this kind of classification problem With this information we would fully suggest that term deposit subscription rate be investigated in a time series setting in addition to using classification. \n",

    "The other variable that has a weight above 1 is duration. This variable denotes the length of the point of last contact with the prospect subscriber. This variable could not be practically used to predict whether a new client will subscribe to a term deposit because one should expect the length of the call to be longer for those customers who decided to opt for the bank term deposit, while those who did not take out a deposit would not stay on the call for as long; therefore, the duration has a direct effect on the outcome of the model but is not a beneficial attribute for creating accurate predictions. However, it can be used as evidence to suggest that the longer you are in contact with a prospective client, the more likely they are to subscribe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of interesting observations, one thing we noticed was how people who were contacted via a non-cellular phone were more likely to subscribe to a term deposit. We also observed a higher chance of a person subscribing if they graduated with a university degree or worked in blue collar or service jobs, however the significance to the model for all of these variables is minor with coefficient values less than .5."

    "The chosen support vectors appear to generally show less separation relative to the original data set. This is because the support vectors will usually select data points on the edge of the class boundaries. However, for certain features, like age, the change in separation is a more difficult to notice. Having performed a detailed EDA in the last lab, we believe less change in separation is likely due to the similarity in distributions between the features and the response classes. Looking at the features that are showing a more drastic change in separation, like nr.employed (number of employees), we see that density plot distributions and peaks are fairly similar and track each other to some degree. This is to be expected because the support vector distributions should reflect the population from which they are being pulled from and again, because the support vector instances are typically on the edge of the class boundaries, the response class density distributions will inevitably be more similar."
