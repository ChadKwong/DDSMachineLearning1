    "For this project, we chose to use the \"Bank Marketing Data Set\" that is stored in the Machine Learning Repository by the University of California, Irvine. The initial purpose of the data was to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a long-term deposit, which would allow the institution to better pursue those customers specifically. The data set contains 21 attributes and 41,188 instances collected via a telephone marketing campaign led by a “Portuguese banking institution” (Moro et al June 2014). While the data set only contains one prescribed target outcome (Long Term Deposits), we chose to additionally perform a second predicition. The second prediction we decided to create was what level of education (i.e., high school, years of college, illiteracy, etc.) is associated with increased potential of taking a long-term deposit. (S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems, Elsevier,\n",
    "62:22-31, June 2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict our two desired outcomes, we constructed models using the remaining predictors. We hypothesized that success from our models would increase the efficiency of our telemarketing team regarding long-term deposits. In addition, the type of customer who is likely to take a long-term deposit can be readily distinguished and targeted, thereby increasing the number of long-term deposits held by the institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting **education** and **term deposit** resulted in us solving a classification problem. Ultimately we decided in predicting **term deposit** through Logistic Regression to provide some room for interpretation, and we chose a more abstract clustering model to predict the **education** of the person of interest. The effectiveness of the classification model will be measured through metrics such as accuracy and recall, where recall is equal to the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives (sensitivity). Additionally, to ensure the strength of our model, we will perform 10 fold cross validation as an attempt to construct a model that will perform well with other data sets.\n"

    "The following code returns basic statistics for the continous variables. We see that for most of the variables the mean value is relatively close to the median, meaning that their distributions are close to normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution was highly skewed for the **duration** attribute, which lists the amount of time the customer spent on the call. However, as noted in the \"Data Meaning Type\" section above, this variable should be removed because the time spent on the call cannot be known until after the call is ended. Obviously, those callers who take out a long-**term deposit** will naturally spend more time on the call, which indicates that this variable is likely to skew results in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also observed heavy skewness in the **pdays** and **previous** variables denoted by the equality between the 1st, 2nd and 3rd quartiles in the variables. While simple statistics present heavy skewness that may suggest omittion from many models, in the future we will focus the modeling methods around those that are not limited to a parameteric distributions."

    "The following code gathers the counts of each categorical column and displays the percentage of each response within the column. **Job** percentages were skewed with administration jobs having 29% of the data, followed by more blue collar professions, specifically blue collar and technicians. Percentages for **marital status** was 57% married, 31% single and 12% divorced. The largest **education** group was subjects with a bachelor degree at 34% followed by people with high school diploma at 25%. The smallest contacted group was people who were illiterate at less than 1%. The percentages of subjects that have **default** was less than 1%. This makes sense as people most likely to have money to save would not be defaulting, so would be most likley to contact that group. Most likely people that do not have defaults were targeted to be contacted. If they had a **housing** loan was 54% verses 46% that did not, so did not play a large factor. 84% of those contacted did not have a personal **loan** while 16% did. 67% of subjects were **contact** by cell phone while 33% were **contact** by traditional land line. The heavist **month** of contact being made was May at 32% respectively followed by July and August at 17% and 15%. The summer months had most **contact** overall. The least **contact** month was December at less than 1%. For **day of week** all contact was made Monday through Friday with most days being close to equal at roughly 20% per day. Friday was the least contacted day at 19%. The outcomes from **previous** campaigns was 85% not part of a **previous** campaign, 11% failed to open a deposit account and 4% opened a deposit account. 13% of respondents **subscribed a term depost** when contacted while 87% did not."
